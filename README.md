You only think this is empty

Everything is empty

This readme is a sham!

Do not disparage the readme!

I have no faith in this readme.

Readme? ReadYOU.

“Beware that, when resolving issues, you yourself do not become an issue... for when you gaze long into the readme, the readme gazes also into you.” - Friedrich Nietzsche
